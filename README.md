# Freedrift_inverse_submit

# These are the scripts that were used for inverting the free drift of sea ice.

# PLEASE NOTE THESE SCRIPTS DO NOT FORM A WORKING DIRECTORY
# they were merely lumped together so they can be read. The best bet is the ipynb

# The main thing that will not work is the NA.
# I have included all the code from the NA that I modified:
some synthetic tests - /Synthetics
then all the various runs I did with data. /NA_Setup
# If you want to use freedrift.na then you will need the rest of the na
# this is available here http://www.iearth.org.au/codes/NA/

# The buoy data used is from Sylvia Cole and will be here http://whoi.edu/itp
# though I'm not sure what format they'll be in.

# The satellite reanalysis data will come from the respective products websites
# I'm sure you can find them.

# Obviously all the directorys are broken

# the currentfuncs scripts were written by ALek Petty, he's awesome https://github.com/akpetty

# I didn't use GitHub when I wrote all this stuff, 
# so there are probably contradictions all over the place as I edited things 
# in different branches and then changed my mind etc.
# I've now learnt the error of my ways and will do better in the future
# ENJOY!!!
